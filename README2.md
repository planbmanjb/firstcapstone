What does your project do?
My vision for this project was to display a Famous person and their
associated wiki page through the use of YouTube and Wikipedia API.
If the user entered nothing there should be an error message.
 
Share the vision of the need that your project is trying to meet.

How is it set up? 
The program uses Jquery and ajax (https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.min.js)
The font was Ubuntu (https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Ubuntu)
You will need to access the Youtube APi (https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/search) using your Youtube API key. The Wikipedia API does not request a key (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php)
If someone were to pick up your codebase today how would they get everything running in their local environment.

How is it used? 
Once its running you should be able to display different famous people and 
receive an error message if you type nothing. 
Once it's up and running provide some very descriptive examples of usage.

Is it in good shape? 
This is my first capstone project so there is no code climate, codeship, or other tools running to indicate the health of the project 
Do you have code climate, codeship, or other tools running to indicate the health of the project? Include information on dependencies as well.

How can others help? 

Collaboration yields amazing software. Make it easy for others to get involved by letting them know how to submit new features, report issues, or offer other assistance.

License information Don't forget to let others know what license your project is released under. Not sure? Oreilly has an open book on understanding licensing.
